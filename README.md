In this weeks homework we were required to make a back end for a e-commerce website. The back end code were divided into many folders. Many of the code were provided. The new code that was implemented were in the routes folder. In this folder there's a index.js file and another folder called api. In the api folder are the routes files where you will find the code responsible for reading, creating, deleting and updating the api data. Above the routes folder there is a models folder. In this folder you'll find the index.js file which contains the code that creats the relationship between the model files.
